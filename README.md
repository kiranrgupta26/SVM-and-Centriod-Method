# SVM-and-Centriod-Method
Support Vector Machine and Centroid Method for classification

SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform your data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs. The kernel trick is a method for computing similarity in the transformed
space using the original attribute set.
SVM also works very well with high-dimensional data and avoids the curse of dimensionality problem.

Centroid methods calculate the proximity between two clusters by calculating the distance between the centroids of clusters.

CentroidMethod mesures the distance between each test point with each cluster centroid and assign the class label of nearest cluster centroid.

Run the whole code and it will give the accuracy/plot graph for SVM , KNN and centroid method for HandWrittenLetters.txt data.
